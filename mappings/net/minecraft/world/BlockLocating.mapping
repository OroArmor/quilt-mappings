		COMMENT Finds the largest rectangle within a histogram, where the vertical bars each have

		COMMENT
		COMMENT @implNote This implementation solves the problem using a stack. The
		COMMENT stack maintains a collection of height limits of rectangles that may grow as the
		COMMENT array iteration continues. When a new height is encountered, each position {@code p}
		COMMENT in the stack would be popped if the rectangle with height limit at position {@code
		COMMENT p} can no longer extend right. The popped rectangle becomes the return value if it
		COMMENT has a larger area than the current candidate.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>When the rectangle area is calculated, the range is between {@code p0 + 1}, where
		COMMENT {@code p0} is the current top of stack after popping rectangles that can no longer
		COMMENT extend, and the current iterated position {@code i}.

		COMMENT @return the base of the rectangle as an inclusive range and the height of the
